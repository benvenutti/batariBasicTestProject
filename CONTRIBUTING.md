Thanks for your help! Here is the branching model for this project:

**master**: main branch. The main branch should always represent a stable version of the project and the build system should always be passing. Before merging, make sure the build is ok!

**issue-"x"**: used to implement issue "x" during development. Should branch off master and merge back into master. The "x" is the actual id number of the issue. For example, issue #10 should branch off from master as **issue-10**.
