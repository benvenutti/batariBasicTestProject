# batariBasicTestProject

This project is a small template for batari basic (bB) code based repositories. The idea is to offer a base project with continuous integration that compiles a small example program written in bB.

### Branches

**master**: main branch;

**issue-"x"**: used to implement issue "x" during development. Should branch off master and merge back into master;
